## A single-layer RT network model

This is the model that goes along with this paper:

[**Tenuous inhibitory GABAergic signaling in the reticular thalamus**](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/38/5/1232)

Details:

+ Required programs:
    + [MATLAB R2015b+](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
    + [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)

+ Main file to launch program is [**neuronlaunch.m**](neuronlaunch.m). The first section of the program contains flags one could change to plot and/or save different outputs. Feel free to play around with it!
